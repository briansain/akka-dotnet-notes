# Welcome!!

Hail and well met! My name is Brian Sain, and I'm a Senior Software Engineer at SignifyHealth. I'm a full stack developer who likes to learn and then teach new technologies. I've been a developer since 2013 and I've worked on a wide range of different applications. My goal for sharing these notes is to make different technologies more accessible for others, but specifically developers trying to learn a new language, architecture, framework, or whatever. There is never a one-size fits all model in the world of development, and the more we know the better we can be. 

## Open Source

It's important to me to have my notes be open source, because I know that I'll mess something up and will need correction, and I wanted to give other people the opportunity to share their own notes or to add on to them or add some more clarifications. Feel free to fork, change, create an issue, request a new topic for me to go over, whatever in github. 

## Akka .Net

This is my first series of notes/videos that I'm making available. I've been working with Akka .Net since 2020, but when I started learning it I noticed that there wasn't a lot of variety of tutorials other than what [Petabridge](https://petabridge.com/) (maintainers of Akka.Net) have produced. They've produced excellent content, and I've had to learn on my own some. I thought I'd add to the ecosystem and offer more resources. I hope you find this useful!
